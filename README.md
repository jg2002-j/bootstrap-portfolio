# Bootstrap Portfolio
Challenge Week 3

## IMPORTANT
This repository was forked from an [earlier commit from another of my own repositories](https://github.com/jg2002-j/portfolio-v2/pull/17).
All work is my own, I just wanted to keep both versions of this project for different purposes.
The complete history of this project can be viewed with all the commits here in this repository, and commits 1 to 15 (i.e. earlier than Jan 3, 2024) on my [Portfolio-v2 repo](https://github.com/jg2002-j/portfolio-v2/commits/main/).
